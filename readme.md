# MERN Practice

> This reppo is for practicing the rudiments of building an express server and api routes

## Key points

- To initialize the express package in your [server.js]("/server.js")

    ```js
    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || //or any port number of your choice
    app.use(express.json()) // specify a middleware to parse your json and be able to access it on your api routes
    ```

  - Then at the end of the file, you listeed to the port to start the server
    `app.listen(PORT, console.log("App is running on port: " + PORT))`

- The app has a bunch of useful methods

    ```
        app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete()
    ```

  - To run a simple get request, this is the syntax:

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World")
    })
    ```

  - Your server port should be stored in an env file and loaded using `process.env.PORT`

    ### Parameters

- To specify route params, we use the `/:(parameter_name)` after the enpoint
  - Route params are used for essential or required values

```js
app.get('/api/courses/:id', (req, res)=>{
     const routeParams = req.params
    res.send(routeParams)     //This returns the route parameter specified in the url to the client
})


```

- Query string parameters are added to the url after a question sign and are usd to provide additional data to the backend service.
  - Query string params are used for optional values

    ```js

    app.get('/api/courses/:id', (req, res)=>{
    const queryParams = req.query
       res.send(queryParams)
    })
        const queryParams = req.query //to access query parameters
    ```

- Always validate responses from the client. This can be done by writing validation logic (specifying appropriate status code and error message) at the beginning of the api route logic or using an npm package called `joi`:

    ```js
     npm i joi
     ```

  - Next steps is to import and use it:

     ```js
     const Joi = require('joi')
      const schema = Joi.object({
        name: Joi.string().min(3).required()
    });

    const { error } = schema.validate(req.body);
    
    if (error) {
        return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);
    }
     ```

### Middlewares

> Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

> If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

  - Execute any code.
  - Make changes to the request and the response objects
  - End the request-response cycle.
  - Call the next middleware in the stack.
  >>*Every middleware function imported can impact the performance of your application*

>Middlewares should be written in a separate file from the [server.js](/server.js) file. Example of a middleware:

```js
function middlewareName(req,res,next){
    //middleware logic
    next()
}
module.exports middlewareName
```

- Examples of middlewares that come with express which must be defined on every server
  - `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))` - this middleware helps to parse URL-encoded bodies, typically from form submissions. The extended: true option allows it to handle more complex data structures.

  - `app.use(express.static('public'))` - specifies the folder where our static files are stored incase we want to serve it to the client.

  - Helmet is a third-party middleware that helps secure your apps by setting various HTTP headers
  
  ```js
  npm i helmet --save
  const helmet = require('helmet')
  app.use(helmet())
  ```

- To check the current environment you are working in and maybe enable some features of your server based on that environment, use either of these:

```js
1. app.get('env') // which will return either development or production
2. process.env.NODE_ENV
```

> To set the environment variable, on your terminal, type `set NODE_ENV=production` or development as the case may be. On mac, use `export NODE_ENV=development/production`

### Configurations

> To store or manage configurations based on the environments or other secrets of your app, you can use an npm package called `rc` or `config`. Create a config folder afterwards and store the configs in json files `example-config.json`
