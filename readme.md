# MERN Practice

> This reppo is for practicing the rudiments of building an express server and api routes

## Key points

- To initialize the express package in your [server.js]("/server.js")

    ```js
    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || //or any port number of your choice
    app.use(express.json()) // specify a middleware to parse your json and be able to access it on your api routes
    ```

  - Then at the end of the file, you listeed to the port to start the server
    `app.listen(PORT, console.log("App is running on port: " + PORT))`

- The app has a bunch of useful methods

    ```        app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete()
    ```

  - To run a simple get request, this is the syntax:

    ```js
    app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World")
    })
    ```

  - Your server port should be stored in an env file and loaded using `process.env.PORT`

    ### Parameters

- To specify route params, we use the `/:(parameter_name)` after the enpoint
  - Route params are used for essential or required values

```js
app.get('/api/courses/:id', (req, res)=>{
     const routeParams = req.params
    res.send(routeParams)     //This returns the route parameter specified in the url to the client
})


```

- Query string parameters are added to the url after a question sign and are usd to provide additional data to the backend service.
  - Query string params are used for optional values

    ```js

    app.get('/api/courses/:id', (req, res)=>{
    const queryParams = req.query
       res.send(queryParams)
    })
        const queryParams = req.query //to access query parameters
    ```

- Always validate responses from the client. This can be done by writing validation logic (specifying appropriate status code and error message) at the beginning of the api route logic or using an npm package called `joi`:

    ```js
     npm i joi
     ```

  - Next steps is to import and use it:

     ```js
     const Joi = require('joi')
      const schema = Joi.object({
        name: Joi.string().min(3).required()
    });

    const { error } = schema.validate(req.body);
    
    if (error) {
        return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);
    }
     ```

### Middlewares

> Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
> If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

  - Execute any code.
  - Make changes to the request and the response objects
  - End the request-response cycle.
  - Call the next middleware in the stack.
  >>*Every middleware function imported can impact the performance of your application*

>Middlewares should be written in a separate file from the [server.js](/server.js) file. Example of a middleware:

```js
function middlewareName(req,res,next){
    //middleware logic
    next()
}
module.exports middlewareName
```

- Examples of middlewares that come with express which must be defined on every server
  - `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))` - this middleware helps to parse URL-encoded bodies, typically from form submissions. The extended: true option allows it to handle more complex data structures.

  - `app.use(express.static('public'))` - specifies the folder where our static files are stored incase we want to serve it to the client.

  - Helmet is a third-party middleware that helps secure your apps by setting various HTTP headers
  
  ```js
  npm i helmet --save
  const helmet = require('helmet')
  app.use(helmet())
  ```

- To check the current environment you are working in and maybe enable some features of your server based on that environment, use either of these:

```js
1. app.get('env') // which will return either development or production
2. process.env.NODE_ENV
```

> To set the environment variable, on your terminal, type `set NODE_ENV=production` or development as the case may be. On mac, use `export NODE_ENV=development/production`

### Configurations

> To store or manage configurations based on the environments or other secrets of your app, you can use an npm package called `rc` or `config`. Create a config folder afterwards and store the configs in json files `example-config.json`
> To debug your application, you can use an npm package called `debug` and install it with `npm debug`. Using it will save you the hassle of commenting out your `console.log` whenever you want to push to production

```js
const startupDebugger = require('debug')('app:startup')
const dbDebugger = require('debug')('app:db')
//Will show the debug log based on the namespace used, db logs and the general app logs

//on the terminal, set an environment variable to determine what kind of debug information we want to see
set DEBUG=app:startup || set DEBUG=app:db

//To reset
set DEBUG=

//To set the debug env to multiple namespaces
set DEBUG=app:*
```

> With the above, you can easily change all the logging messages to use the type of debug log you want as shown

```js
   startupDebugger("Morgan enabled...") //will show general app logs
dbDebugger("Database message") //will show only bugs related to the db
```

### Templating Engines
>
> Templating can be done with npm packages like `pug or ejs`

- pug requires a [views](/views)
  - It also requires an [index.pug](/views/index.pug) file where the static content are saved
  
  In server.js, initialize pug as seen below

```js
app.set('view engine', 'pug')
app.set('views', './views') //default

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render("index", { title: "Express Practice App", message: "Hello World" })
    //use the render method, specify the index route, the second argument should be the variables defined in the index.pug file as well as the values for those variables
})

```

### File Structure

In express, all the api enpoints should be classified in a routes file/folder and imported into the main server file to ensure that the codebase is modular and clean.

- In the [routes](/routes) folder, create different files for different routes like the [courses](/routes/courses.js) routes is for all the enpoints that has to do with courses. The project structure looks like

```js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(courses)
})

module.exports = router 
```

- Then in your main server.js file, import and use the route you just created:

```js
const courses = require('./routes/courses')
app.use('/api/courses', courses)
```
